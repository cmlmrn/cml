Hi! I'm Camille. 🌿
This is my personal repository where I share my learning journey, ideas, and experiences in teaching, writing, and coding--as a baby in this industry.

## 📌 Projects
- **Story Translations** - Waldorf stories from different books translated to Tagalog for children aged 7-9
- **Waldorf Stories** - Waldorf stories about nature, letters and numbers for children aged 7-9

## ✨ About Me
I'm a Waldorf teacher, a tutor, and a learner working self-development through education and story telling. I love learning slowly but surely.

## 🛠️ Tools I use
- Google Docs / Sheets
- Microsoft Excel
- Canva

As I always say, "Keep growing. 🌱"
